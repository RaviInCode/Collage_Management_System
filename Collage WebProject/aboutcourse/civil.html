  <h1>Civil Engineering Course</h1>
  
  <h2>Course Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Civil Engineering is a prominent field of engineering that focuses on the design, construction, and maintenance of infrastructure and building projects. It plays a crucial role in shaping the physical environment and is involved in various stages of project development, from conceptualization to completion.
  </p>

  <h2>Sub-branches of Civil Engineering</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Structural Engineering: This sub-branch deals with the design and analysis of structures, ensuring their stability and strength. Structural engineers work on bridges, buildings, dams, and other large-scale projects.</li>
    <li>Geotechnical Engineering: Geotechnical engineers study the behavior of soil and rocks to assess their suitability for construction projects. They analyze foundations, slopes, and earth-retaining structures.</li>
    <li>Transportation Engineering: Transportation engineers focus on the planning, design, and operation of transportation systems, including roads, highways, railways, and airports.</li>
    <li>Water Resources Engineering: Water resources engineers manage water-related projects such as water supply systems, wastewater treatment plants, and flood control measures.</li>
    <li>Environmental Engineering: Environmental engineers address environmental issues related to construction projects, waste management, pollution control, and sustainable development.</li>
    <li>Construction Management: Construction managers oversee the execution of projects, ensuring timely completion, cost efficiency, and adherence to safety standards.</li>
  </ul>
