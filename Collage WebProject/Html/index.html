                 The instructor was incredibly knowledgeable and articulate.
                  This was the first time I have taken a class in a remote format, 
                  and I was delighted with it and look forward to coming back to
                   ONLC for more classes in the future. I loved the fact that even 
                   though I was in a class with other people, the actual physical 
                   space was private and quiet and very conducive to learning! Thank you.

                and therefore I would definitely be interested in attending
                 other classes in the same format. The instructor was very
                  knowlegeable and provided a wealth of information about the 
                  current version, especially since the last version I used 
                  was several releases ago.
